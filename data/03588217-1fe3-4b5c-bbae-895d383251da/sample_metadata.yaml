issue: |
   RPM build failed due to missing dependency  `pkgconfig(mjpegtools) >= 2.0.0`.
   In order to resolve the issue, make sure that all dependencies required by the package
   are available in installed repositories.
log_detective_version: 2.0.0
log_detective_analysis: |
    The build failed because a dependency, `pkgconfig(mjpegtools) >= 2.0.0`, could not be resolved during the `dnf5 builddep` stage within the mock environment.
    This indicates that the required version of `mjpegtools` or its pkgconfig file is not available in the configured repositories.
    Ensure that the repository containing `mjpegtools` is enabled and that the package version meets the requirement.
    Alternatively, if the package is not essential, consider using `--skip-unavailable` to bypass the missing dependency, although this might lead to other issues if the package is indeed required.
