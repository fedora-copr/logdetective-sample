issue: |
    Build failed due to missing patch file `gnome-shell-notify-gnome-session.patch`.
    TFixing the issue, requires making sure that all patch files specified in the `SOURCES` directory.
log_detective_version: 2.0.0
log_detective_analysis: |
   The RPM build failed because the patch file `gnome-shell-notify-gnome-session.patch`, specified in the `gnome-shell.spec` file, was not found in the `SOURCES` directory.
   This caused the `rpmbuild -bs` command to fail within the mock environment.
   To resolve this, ensure that the patch file is present in the `SOURCES` directory or remove the reference to the missing patch from the spec file.
