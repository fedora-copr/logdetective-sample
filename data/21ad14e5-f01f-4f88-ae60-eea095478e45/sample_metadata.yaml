issue: |
    Compilation failed due to undefined reference to `gf_estimate_kernel' and `estimate_kernel'.
log_detective_version: 2.0.0
log_detective_analysis: |
    The RPM build failed during the `%build` phase while applying a patch, indicated by the context mismatch and the `ninja` build system stopping. Additionally, there are discrepancies in the definition of the `verbose` field within the `estimate_kernel.hpp` file and a naming conflict in another translation unit.

    Solution:

    Address the patch failure by regenerating or updating the patch to match the current source code. Resolve the `verbose` field discrepancy and naming conflict by ensuring consistent definitions across all translation units, potentially by using namespaces or renaming conflicting fields.

    Drain3 does not extract the interesting part.
    There were multiple warnings in generated during compilation.
