issue: |
    Multiple compilation errors in `MsgHandler.h`.
    This includes warnings that were raised to the level of errors with `-Wtemplate-body` option.
log_detective_version: 2.0.0
log_detective_analysis: |
    The RPM build process failed during the `%build` phase while building the `dolphin-emu.spec` file. The `gmake` command exited with an error code of 2, and the underlying issue is that the `rpmbuild` command failed within a `systemd-nspawn` container. The `Makefile` target `all` failed, causing the build to halt. Review the `Makefile` and build scripts for errors, and ensure all dependencies are met.
