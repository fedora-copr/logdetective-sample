    Compilation of `neqo-crypto` target failed, as cargo couldn't find symbol `ssl_grp_kem_mlkem768x25519` in module `ssl::SSLNamedGroup`.
    Numerous warnings were produced during the compilation, pointing out minor issues with the code.
log_detective_version: 2.0.0
log_detective_analysis: |
    The RPM build failed during the `%build` phase with a non-zero exit status. This was triggered by a failure within a `systemd-nspawn` container, where the `rpmbuild` command itself failed while processing `firefox.spec`. The root cause appears to be related to a `gmake` error during the Rust cargo library build, and a missing configuration object required by the 'mach' tool.
    
    Recommendation:
    
    1.  Investigate the `rust.mk` file and the Rust build environment for potential issues.
    2.  Ensure that the necessary configuration files for the 'mach' tool are present and accessible during the build process, potentially by running `mach build` as suggested.
    3.  Address the 35 compiler warnings, as they might indicate underlying code problems that contribute to the build failure.

notes: |
    Log contains many very long lines, this can lead to failure during tokenization by overflowing model context limit.
    Heuristics employed by Log Detective before application of Drain are attempting to mitigate this,
    by splitting lines that are too long. But this leads loss of information.
